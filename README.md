# FlatironRunner

A runner / obstacle type game built using a Rails backend and JS frontend as part of the Flatiron School Curriculum. 

## Installation

After cloning the repo, install the dependencies by executing the below command in your terminal from within the flatiron-runner-backend directory: 

$ bundle install

Launch the server using the below command in your terminal within the flatiron-runner-backend directory once you've opened the index.html file from the flatiron-runner-front directory in your browser:

$ rails server  

## Usage 

Upon launching the server and opening the index.html file in your browser you'll arrive at the game's homescreen. 

Inputting a username into the username box will either create a new Player or retrieve your existing information from the database. 

Once your information has been retrieved, you'll see the page update to display your username, your hi-score, and a selection box for the level you'd like to play on (currently up to 6 levels). 

After selecting a level, you can click on the screen to start the game. 

You can move your character using the below commands:
- a to move left 
- d to move right 
- spacebar to jump (you can jump multiple times)

Now just try to dodge the bombs coming at you for as long as you can. Enjoy!
